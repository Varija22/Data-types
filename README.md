Aim:
To write a C++ program that accepts values of different data types (int, float, char, double, string, and bool), displays their values, and shows their respective sizes in bytes.

Tools Used:

Programiz (Online C++ compiler)

Visual Studio Code (with C++ extension and GCC compiler)

Theory:
C++ supports multiple data types like int, float, char, double, string, and bool. Each type has a predefined size in memory which can be checked using the sizeof() operator. The program takes user inputs of these types and prints the entered values along with their sizes. The string type supports various functions, including .length() to determine the number of characters in a string.

Algorithm:

1.Start the program.

2.Declare variables of type int, float, char, double, string, and bool.

3.Prompt the user to enter values for each data type.

4.Read and store the inputs using cin.

5.Display the entered values using cout.

6.Use the sizeof() operator to display the size of each data type.

7.For string, display the length using .length().

8.End the program.

Conclusion:
The C++ program was successfully written and executed. It helped in understanding how different data types work, how to take input and display output, and how to determine memory size using the sizeof() operator.
